# SentiSnap
## Description
This project is inspired by the growing importance of understanding people's feelings and opinions online, especially in Arabic reviews. Nowadays, what people say online is a big deal, and it influences what others think and decide. However, it's not always easy to figure out how people feel in these online discussions.
#
The main goal is to create a tool that helps users, including online brands, influencers, and companies, better understand the sentiments expressed in Arabic reviews on different social media platforms, particularly Instagram and Facebook. Ultimately, we hope that this tool will empower brands, influencers, and companies to improve their products, content, or any related aspects based on the sentiments expressed in the reviews, leading to continuous enhancement and better connection with their audience.
#
The main area of this project is the integration of sentiment analysis and machine 
learning. Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a natural language 
processing (NLP) task that involves determining the sentiment or emotional tone 
expressed in a piece of text. It is widely used in various applications, such as social 
media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and market research. Machine 
learning techniques are commonly employed for sentiment analysis due to their 
ability to automatically learn patterns and relationships from data.
